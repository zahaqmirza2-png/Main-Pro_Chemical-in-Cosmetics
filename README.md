## Project Title
**Cosmetic Products Risk & Discontinuation Analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib**

---

## 1. Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing cosmetic product data to understand **chemical risk levels**, **product discontinuation patterns**, **company-wise distributions**, and **primary product categories**.

The analysis uses Python data analysis libraries to identify trends related to **high-, medium-, and low-risk chemicals** and how they influence **product lifecycle decisions**.

The goal of this project is to extract **meaningful insights** that can support **product safety evaluation, regulatory compliance, and strategic decision-making** in the cosmetics industry.

## 2. Tools Used

- **Pandas** – Data cleaning, aggregation, and analysis  
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization and plotting  
- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab** – Interactive analysis environment  

---

## 3. Dataset

- **Source:** Cosmetic product and chemical dataset  
- **Description:**  
  The dataset contains structured information related to cosmetic products, their chemical composition, risk classification, and discontinuation status.

### Key Columns Include:
- Company Name  
- Product Name  
- Primary Category  
- Chemical Name  
- Chemical Count  
- Risk Level (Low / Medium / High)  
- Discontinued Status  

---

## 4. Steps Followed

1. Imported the dataset using **Pandas**  
2. Cleaned the data by removing missing and duplicate values  
3. Standardized categorical and numerical fields  
4. Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
5. Grouped data by:
   - Company  
   - Product category  
   - Chemical risk level  
   - Discontinued status  
6. Created visualizations using **Matplotlib**  
7. Interpreted results to extract meaningful insights  

---

## 5. Key Insights

- Makeup products (non-permanent) show the highest number of discontinued products  
- Companies with larger product portfolios experience higher discontinuation counts  
- Low-risk products dominate discontinuation numbers, indicating business-driven decisions  
- High-risk discontinued products are fewer but concentrated among specific companies  
- Discontinuation trends are influenced more by category dominance and scale than risk alone  

---

## 6. Visualizations

- Company-wise product distribution  
- Category-wise discontinued product analysis  
- Risk-level comparison (Low, Medium, High)  
- Pie chart of top high-risk cosmetic products by chemical composition  

---

## 7. Files Included

- `MainProject.ipynb` – Complete analysis and visualizations  
- `cscpopen data.csv` – Raw dataset  
- `README.md` – Project documentation  
- `.gitignore` – Git ignore configuration

## 8. How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zahaqmirza2-png/Main-Pro_Chemical-in-Cosmetics.git
2.	Open MainProject.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
	3.	Run the notebook cells step by step to view the analysis and visualizations
	4.	Modify the code to explore additional insights if required
# 9. Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib can be effectively used for real-world cosmetic data analysis. By integrating chemical risk levels with product and company information, the analysis highlights important trends in product safety, discontinuation behavior, and industry practices.

The insights derived from this project can support regulatory monitoring, safer product development, and informed decision-making in the cosmetics industry.
