    " Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project analyzes a Chemicals in Cosmetics Dataset obtained from Data.gov, the official open data platform of the United States Government. The dataset provides detailed information about cosmetic and personal care products, including product names, brands, companies, primary and sub-categories, and the chemical ingredients used in these products.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this analysis is to explore the usage and distribution of chemicals across various cosmetic categories, such as makeup, hair care, and nail products. By performing data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), this project aims to identify patterns related to chemical frequency, product categories, and brand-level trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through descriptive statistics and visualizations, the analysis seeks to generate meaningful insights that can support consumer awareness, regulatory understanding, and industry-level evaluation of chemical usage in cosmetic products."
